"""Abstract ``Backend`` contract: pure API/session exchange, no role knowledge.

DESIGN ONLY (Step 1 of the refactor, see docs/refactor-step1.md). This module
defines shapes, not behavior -- every method body is a stub. Nothing in
``eva.assistant`` or ``eva.user_simulator`` depends on this yet.

A ``Backend`` wraps exactly one provider integration (OpenAI Realtime, Gemini
Live, ElevenLabs Agents, a cascade STT->LLM->TTS pipeline, ...) and exposes a
uniform send/receive surface for exchanging audio, text, and tool-call
traffic with that provider. It has **no opinion about role** -- it does not
know whether it is being driven by an ``AssistantRole`` or a ``UserRole``,
and it does not decide *what* prompt or tools to use (the ``Role`` supplies
those at open-time and owns tool execution).

Symmetry note (per the design doc): a ``Backend`` must not assume it is "the
network server side" or "the client side" of a connection. Today,
assistant-side backends happen to be reached by an inbound WebSocket
connection (Twilio-framed) and user-side backends happen to dial out to a
provider or to the assistant's socket. Both are just implementation details
of a concrete subclass's ``open()``/``send()``/``receive()`` -- the abstract
contract itself is direction-agnostic so that a later mediator can sit
between two ``Backend`` instances (Backend <-> mediator <-> Backend) without
requiring either side to be "the server."

    re-engages after a dropped user turn (the turn-end fallback; see
    ``AssistantRole``'s ``turn_end_fallback_seconds`` and the shipped
    ``eva.assistant.pipeline.fallback``) tags the ``AUDIO_OUTPUT``/
    ``TRANSCRIPT`` event it emits for that turn so callers can distinguish a
    fallback nudge from an ordinary model turn (e.g. for audit logging and so
    downstream metrics can zero it). The shipped feature records the transcript
    marker with ``message_type="turn_fallback"``; a backend surfacing the same
    turn here should carry an equivalent flag in ``metadata`` (e.g.
    ``metadata["turn_fallback"] = True``). This is *not* a new event type -- a
    nudge is just an ordinary turn from the backend's model, triggered by the

class Backend(ABC):
    """Pure API/session exchange with one provider. No role knowledge.

    Lifecycle: ``open()`` establishes the session, ``send()`` pushes audio /
    text / tool results to the provider, ``receive()`` yields events back,
    and ``close()`` tears the session down. A ``Role`` (see
    ``eva.role.base``) owns one ``Backend`` instance and drives it.

    Implementations are expected to fall along a spectrum:

    - **Native speech-to-speech** (OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live): a single
      persistent duplex session; ``send(audio=...)`` streams mic audio in,
      ``receive()`` yields interleaved ``AUDIO_OUTPUT``/``TRANSCRIPT``/
      ``TOOL_CALL_REQUEST``/``TURN_END`` events as the provider produces them.
    - **Cascade** (STT -> LLM -> TTS, e.g. a Pipecat pipeline): internally
      composed of separate provider calls, but from the caller's perspective
      still just one ``Backend`` -- it decides internally when to run STT,
      call the LLM, and synthesize TTS, and surfaces the same event shape.
    - **End-to-end / thin** (ElevenLabs Agents): the provider handles
      everything (ASR, dialogue policy, TTS) opaquely. Such a ``Backend``
      may only ever emit ``AUDIO_OUTPUT``/``TRANSCRIPT``/``TURN_END``/
      ``ERROR`` and may treat ``send(tool_result=...)`` as a no-op or raise
      ``NotImplementedError`` -- callers must consult ``capabilities`` and
      not assume every method does something on every backend.

    Symmetry: this contract says nothing about which side dials out and
    which side is dialed into -- see the module docstring.
