"""Key entity accuracy metric using LLM-as-judge (entire conversation).

Measures whether the user's key entities (names, dates, confirmation codes,
amounts, etc.) survived intact through the agent's pipeline. The comparison
target depends on the pipeline type:

- **CASCADE**: compares what the user was instructed to say (``intended_user_turns``)
  against what the agent's STT transcribed (``transcribed_user_turns``) — i.e.
  transcription accuracy.
- **Audio-native (S2S / AUDIO_LLM)**: there is no reliable STT output to inspect,
  so the agent's **tool-call arguments** (from ``conversation_trace``) become the
  evidence of what it understood. If the user says "my id is EM123" and the agent
  then calls a tool with "EMP124", the agent misheard the entity.

Debug metric for diagnosing model performance issues, not directly used in
final evaluation scores.
