    It also emits per-cause diagnostic sub-metrics
    (``conversation_correctly_finished.<cause>_rate``) splitting *why* the agent went silent.
    These fire (``1.0``) only on failures, but are emitted as ``0.0`` on every clean finish too,
    so their cross-record mean reads as "fraction of all conversations with this cause" —
    matching how faithfulness dimension rates aggregate (denominator = all records, not just
    failures). The orthogonal input-characteristic flags (``final_turn_*``) stay failure-only,
    since they describe the unanswered final turn.
