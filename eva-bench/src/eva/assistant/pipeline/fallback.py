"""Turn-end fallback: nudge the assistant to reprompt when a user turn is never detected.

The assistant normally responds only when the pipeline detects a completed user turn.
When VAD / turn detection silently drops a real user utterance (observed in the wild: the
caller speaks but no turn-start/turn-end fires, so nothing is ever processed), the call
would otherwise hang until the provider's inactivity backstop ends it ~2 minutes later.

This module provides a shared timer that arms once the assistant stops speaking and, after
``turn_end_fallback_time`` seconds of no detected user turn, fires a nudge asking the caller
to repeat. It is hosted on the pipeline spine (``UserObserver``) so it works for both the
cascade and audio-LLM pipelines, and it invokes a pipeline-specific ``process_turn_fallback``
to actually inject the nudge (the two pipelines drive the model differently).

    starts speaking or an inter-turn timeout elapses; neither happens between back-to-back
    nudges, so their TTS collapses into one tracked turn/segment. Emitting an emulated
    user-turn boundary marks that decision explicitly.
